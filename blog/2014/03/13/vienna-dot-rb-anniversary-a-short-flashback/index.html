<div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m sitting at <a href="http://sektor5.at/">sektor5</a>, our long time host for our monthly user group meeting, and am trying to remember the last
year. Yes, it&rsquo;s really been a year already. Over a year if you consider that it begun with us (Andy, Floor and me)
complaining about the non-existant interaction between ruby users in Vienna. Shortly after that, it got too fast for me,
and I just tried to hang tight and not get lost on the ride &hellip;</p>

<p>From &ldquo;somebody <strong>should</strong> do something&rdquo; to &ldquo;Hey, we got a first sponsor and host!&rdquo;, we did a lot of things, like setting
up a web page, finding that first sponsor and a place to meet, and, mainly, getting the word out. Well, I wasn&rsquo;t too
involved with everything except setting up the basis for the web page and then providing the occasional content and
talk.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been great to stand at the sidelines and see the community grow. Within a year, we managed to get from zero to more
than 200 (214 actually!) rubyists. I heard a LOT of interesting talks, and learned a bit from every pick the others
provided (and also by myself searching for a good pick and getting lost in the internets).</p>

<p>But I guess it&rsquo;s the time to really, really give a big <strong>THANK YOU</strong> to Floor. It must have been hard at the beginning -
getting programmers and the like to submit stuff at a regular basis is worse than herding cats. I just saw the reaction.
For Viennese standards, we had people basically breaking down the doors to get in. I have to admit that at the very
first meeting I succumbed to a bad cold, but already at the second meeting we had more people than I dared to dream of.
And that has been the work of one of the busiest women I&rsquo;ve ever met.</p>

<p>Also, Andy has been invaluable in getting people to behave, having talks lined up and starting off the evening. And
together we managed to do last minute stuff, rush people from here to there and generally make it look like no one ever
broke a sweat (but we did occasionally, really).</p>

<p>How much has happened this year! Ruby 1.8.7 was discontinued, Ruby matured from 2.0.0-p0 to 2.1.1, Ruby and Rails had
many vulnerabilities fixed, security awareness shifted dramatically &hellip;</p>

<p>We also had turbulent times: we attended meeting at Rubyslava &amp; PyVo in Bratislava to meet our new friends who
definitely helped us set up the whole thing and really helped us with their presence. Shout out to you guys!</p>

<p>Additionally, a lot of other events were sprouting off the success of the group: <a href="http://railsgirls.com/">Rails Girls</a> events all over
Europe, <a href="http://www.pyladies.com/">PyLadies</a> meetings, coding dojos, etc.</p>

<p>For me it was a lot of fun, a lot of new things that happend all around us, and then the saddest thing happened: Floor
and Andy decided to move on, so Berlin got two great people, organizers and &lsquo;just do it&rsquo; guys. And the next team took
over &ndash; Laura, Ben and Alex (with me again on the sidelines). A surprisingly huge load of work awaited, but we
eventually mastered it. Not least because we have a steady host with sektor5, which brings the necessary work every
month down a <strong>lot</strong>.</p>

<p>So, I&rsquo;m going to close that now because the first people have already arrived, and we are going to be busy soon -
preparing cupcakes, stickers, t shirts and whatever talks and other things still have to finish.</p>

<p>Thanks to all and to a successful next year! (I almost wrote &lsquo;beer&rsquo; now. Cheers!).</p>

<p><em>PS: Also thanks to our today&rsquo;s sponsor, <a href="http://platogo.com/">platogo</a>!</em></p>
