### 02/17 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the one-hundred-forty-third edition:

##### [Laura][1]:
- [][2] - 
- [][3] - 
- [][4] - 

##### [Ramón][5]:
- [][6] - 
- [][7] - 
- [][8] - 

##### [Markus][9]:
- [So You Want to Use Pathnames…][10] - If you're working with paths or filenames in Ruby, [Piotr Szotkowski](https://twitter.com/chastell) shows why using the `Pathname` class is so much nicer than just using plain `String`s.
- [Kill Your Dependencies][12] - Dependency bloat afflicts all languages. In Ruby, it's especially easy to have your dependencies explode. [Mike Perham](https://twitter.com/mperham) shares some tips on reducing your own dependencies.
- [TIL: clock skew exists][11] - [Martin Kleppmann recently wrote a critique of the Redlock distributed locking algorithm](http://martin.kleppmann.com/2016/02/08/how-to-do-distributed-locking.html). Amongst his criticisms was that clocks can very easily become skewed. Julia Evans investigates this phenomenon a bit more, and what exactly can happen to a clock on a computer.

##### [Aaron][13]:

##### [Tawan][17]:
- [Fish shell design documentation][18] - I recently switched from zsh to fish shell, and so far I'm quite happy with it. If you haven't already, you should definitely take a look and [try it out](https://fishshell.com/). I picked the design documentation of Fish shell, because it's a good read and it resonates a lot with the experience I had so far.
