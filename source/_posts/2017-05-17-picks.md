### 05/17 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the two-hundred-tenth edition:


##### [Laura][laura]

##### [Ramón][ramon]

##### [Markus][markus]
- [Programming with a love of the implicit][markus-1] - DHH argues against "it's always better to be explicit"
- [NASA’s ten coding commandments][markus-2] - Maybe following them everywhere would improve software quality in general? (although some of the rules are quite specific to low-level languages)
- [The Architects Below][markus-3] - Software influences behavior, often with implications that we software developers rarely think about when gathering requirements or building software.
