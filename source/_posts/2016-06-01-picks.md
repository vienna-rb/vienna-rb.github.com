### 06/01 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the one-hundred-sixty-first edition:

##### [Laura][1]:
- [Rails Has Won: The Elephant in the Room][2] - Highlighting why Rails was a success and still looking at the issue critically, Fabio Akita wrote an article that couples nicely with Piotr Solnica's post shared last week
- [Pushing RubyGems.org forward][3] - For all of us who use Ruby Gems on a (probably) daily basis, [Nick Quaranto][4] wrote a post about the current state of RubyGems.org and helping it go forward by contributing to the project, giving feedback on policies, and more.


##### [Markus][9]:
- [Learn Lua in 15 Minutes][10] - Lua is a lovely dynamic language that, due to its size, is a favorite for embedding, while still offering a lot of performance. And now you can also learn it in 15 minutes!
- [Updating a classic][11] - Charles Stross updated the OSA's "Simple Sabotage Field Manual" from WW2 to modern times, so you can sabotage a rival tech start-up. "It's often hard to know where incompetence ends and malice begins"
- [How to get anything done? - 4 tips][12] - Robert Pankowecki with 4 very practical tips to get shit done.


##### [Max][17]:
- [Abstractions and the role of a framework][18] - Nice follow up to last week's extensively debated [My time with Rails is up][19] post, sharing thoughts on the different levels of abstraction and how frameworks come into play there.
- [Your Program is a Special and Unique Snowflake][20] - Deciding on the level of abstraction on an even lower, per line level.
- [How to Win the Coding Interview][21] - Advice to survive and actually understand whiteboard and co.

##### [Pilar][22]:
- [Gitfiti][23] - Pixel art in your git history - because why not.
- [You Feel Like Shit: An Interactive Self Care Guide][24] - An interactive guide to help you read internal signals and take care of yourself.
