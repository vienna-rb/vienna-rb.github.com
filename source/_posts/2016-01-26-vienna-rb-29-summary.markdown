# Vienna.rb #29 â€” Summary

Happy new year! For our twenty-ninth Vienna.rb we had a relatively laid back edition. Great time to catch up after the winter break!

For starters, some announcements:

- The Rails Girls Summer of Code Call for Projects is open! Submit your open source project and help support newcomers get into open source software development. Find out more [http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/guide/projects/](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/guide/projects/)
- We'd love to get feedback from you! Drop us a line at hello@vienna-rb.at
- Our Slack channel is live! Sign up [here](http://vienna-rb-slack.herokuapp.com/).

We kicked off with a proposal from [Max](https://twitter.com/klappradla) on dedicating some time for members of the meetup to come up and give us a quick look into their daily work toolchain. A 'How We Work', if you will.


## Our Talks

For our main talk, [Aaron](https://twitter.com/mraaroncruz) showed us 'Crystal For Rubyists'.  The main issue with Ruby being discussed nowadays is that of concurrency. While looking at alternatives, such as Go, Elixir, and the IO language, Aaron came upon the [Crystal](http://crystal-lang.org/) language.

Some plus points about Crystal:

- It's got a Ruby-like syntax. So much so, that when showing us some code, Aaron had initially led us to believe that we were looking at Ruby, when we were in fact looking at Crystal. Devious!
- It's statically typed.
- It has a Go-like concurrency.
- You can generate new projects with the Crystal command line interface.
- You can compile and run your code, but also do so separately, as you would with `C`.

Be sure to check out the [Awesome page](awesome-crystal.com) for Crystal!

## Discussion Round

Our discussion round was broken into smaller groups, but here's some tips that came up:

- [Prezto: Config framework for zsh](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto)
- [Mensch: Menlo-like font](http://robey.lag.net/2010/06/21/mensch-font.html)

That, along with some friendly catching up and meeting new folks, wrapped up our meetup!

Looking forward to the next one!
