### 05/11 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the one-hundred-fifty-eighth edition:

##### [Laura][1]:
- [GitHub README Analyzer][2] - A small tool to analyse and improve your project's readme. 
- [GitHub introduces unlimited private repositories for individuals][3] - If, like me, you've been paying for private repositories monthly at GitHub, these news will make you happy: instead of 5 private repos, you now get an unlimited amount. 
- [Ruby Book Club on RailsConf][4] - I was at RailsConf last week <3 There were a lot of high quality talks (expect more links to those in the future) and Ruby Book Club have done a special on their experience of the conference.

##### [RamÃ³n][5]:
- [Gem: `scss_lint`][6] - A neat analysis tool for your SCSS that's configurable!
- [][7] -
- [][8] -

##### [Markus][9]:
- [Nobody Cares How Hard You Work][12]
- [What Happens to Lazy Programmers?][10]
- [When to Rewrite from Scratch - Autopsy of a Failed Software][11]

##### [Aaron][13]:
- [4 ways to early return from a rails controller][14] - All you've ever wanted to know about returning from a controller action in rails. Really good stuff to know.
- [waffle.io][15] - If trello and github had a beatiful baby. I've been using it for project management lately and I'm lovin' it.
- [Kramdown][16] - Fully Ruby markdown intrepreter. Made with <3 in Austria.

##### [Max][17]:
- [23 Years of Ruby with Matz][18] - [Matz][19] being nice and funny while sharing some insights on his (and Ruby's) history on the [Changelog][20].
- [How to learn web frameworks][21] - Another possible and possibly sane approach to the abyss of web frameworks and its destructive powers on junior devs.
- [Real open source has much, much more to do than just code][22] - [Steve Klabnik][23] showing how to use nice and wisely chosen words to educate narrow-minded rubyists (they sadly do exist).
