### 02/08 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the one-hundred-ninety-sixth edition:

##### [Markus][markus]
- [Foggy thinking in design (and how to cut through it)][markus-1] - While this article deals with design, you can easily apply it to programming.
- [howfuckedismydatabase.com][markus-2]
- [How to Build a Skyscraper by Ernie Miller (RailsConf 2016)][markus-3] - This is not a talk about how to build a skyscraper.
