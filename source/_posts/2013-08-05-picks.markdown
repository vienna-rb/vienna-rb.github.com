  - [Animated Opacity for Hangout Overlays][10] - The Hangouts API team recently released a new feature in the Dev Channel of the Hangouts API, that allows controlling the opacity of overlays. Check out how Gerwin Sturm's has been playing around with the code to create some [awesome effects][13]. 
  - [Never leave the terminal][11] - Konstantin Haase shared this great resource. Go watch it!
  - [#pairwithme][12] - We'd love to experiment a little with pair programming sessions! For the next meetup we reserve 18:00 - 19:00 for pairing, with the talks starting at 19:15. Drop by at 6pm and we'll hook you up with a partner!
