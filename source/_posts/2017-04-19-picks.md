### 04/19 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the two-hundred-sixth edition:

##### [Markus][markus]
- [Versioning a Rails API][markus-1] - Thoughts on multiple strategies on how to version your API
- [Rails Benchmarking: Puma and MultiProcess][markus-2] - How to figure out how many threads and processes to configure Puma with. The actual numbers aren't that interesting, but the way to get there is what's important.
- [cssreference.io][markus-3] - For when you don't remember what a (popular) CSS property actually does: this includes visual examples.
