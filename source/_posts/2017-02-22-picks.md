### 02/22 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the one-hundred-ninety-eighth edition:


##### [Laura][laura]
- [Getting started with vim][laura-1] - A really good post and collection of resources combined in an intuitive way for vim beginners!
- [Exploring unseen Open Source infrastructure][laura-2] - A ton of projects rely on Open Source infrastructure that is “invisible” and often mistaken for unimportant. In this post, Andrew Nesbitt presents a small feature of his project [libraries.io][laura-3] to help us be aware of those projects.

##### [Ramón][ramon]

##### [Markus][markus]
- [Programmer, Interrupted][markus-1]
- [The Dark Standup][markus-2]
- [Don’t overlook the quiet voices and contributions][markus-3] - It's easy to listen to the loud voices. But the quiet ones are just as important, but not as easy to listen to.

##### [Max][max]
