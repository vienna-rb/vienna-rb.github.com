### 03/08 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the two-hundredth edition:

##### [Markus][markus]
- [How to Stop Hating Your Tests][markus-1] - How your tests can go wrong, and what to do about it.
- [Testing Ruby's Unicode Support][markus-3] - It's definitely improved since 1.8, but there are still some pitfalls you should be aware of.
- [Communicating Intent][markus-2] - How to use Rust's type system to communicate intent.

##### [Max][max]
- [Data Transfer Object in Ruby][max-1] - DTOs, a helpful pattern to save your business logic from getting too cluttered with huge parameter lists and data transformations.
- [A Career Retrospective][max-2] - Somewhat alarming, sad but also inspiring writeup of "10 years working in tech" by the awesome [Sailor Mercury][sailorhg].
- [Phoenix 1.3][max-3] - Interesting talk on the changes in [Phoenix][phoenix] and the thoughts and motivation behind them.
