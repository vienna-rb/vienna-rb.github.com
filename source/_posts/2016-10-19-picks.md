### 10/19 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the one-hundred-eighty-first edition:

##### [Markus][markus]
- [ripgrep is faster than {grep, ag, git grep, ucg, pt, sift}][markus-1] - `ripgrep` is a new search tool written in Rust, and this blog post goes into the details why its faster than the others (including benchmarks!)
- [How to be* a compiler — make a compiler with JavaScript][markus-2] - An excellent and well-written introduction to how compilers do their work (by teaching you to become one)
- [Reflections of an "Old" Programmer][markus-3] - Contains lots of excellent advice

##### [Max][max]
- [Fuck You Startup World][max-1] - Hilarious, yet somehow also sad and alarming post on the state of the startup world and its 'I-must-optimize-every-living-second' lifestyle.
- [Atom 1.11][max-2] - Atom 1.11 is out, with lots of improvements (and a custom title bar).
- [Microservices @ Spotify][max-3] - Some interesting insights on Spotify's service- and team-setup.
