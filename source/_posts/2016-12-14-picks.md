##### [Markus][markus]
- [The Best Password Managers][markus-1] - The Wirecutter looks at the best password managers out there. If you don't use one already, take a look, then pick one.
- [Decrypting TLS Browser Traffic With Wireshark – The Easy Way!][markus-2] - Sometimes, you do need to debug TLS traffic. With this trick, you can even do it when you use certificate pinning.
- [A Comprehensive Guide to Terraform][markus-3] - Terraform is a tool to programatically provide & manage infrastructure - both servers and software.

##### [Max][max]
- [DRY up your domain models using a struct table][max-1] - Unconventional but super neat refactoring technique.
- [Clean your desk][max-2] - Second in a series of posts causing shitstorms at Amazon (quite rightly).
- [I Think It's a Fish][max-3] - Funny, trolly episode of the Bike Shed with insights on day-to-day (open source) work.
