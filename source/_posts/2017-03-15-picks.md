### 03/15 Picks!

In a series on this website we'll entertain YOU with our picks - or: what we think is worth sharing - every week.
Books, articles, gems, fun stuff... you're in for an eclectic mix! So, here's for the two-hundred-first edition:

##### [Markus][markus]
- [The 4-letter-word word that makes my blood boil][markus-1] - I'm guilty of overusing it.
- [How to perform a good code review][markus-2] - A very good reference post.
- [Setting up a Rust Development Environment][markus-3] - If you want to get started with Rust, this post will get you off the ground.
